When ColorImage.cpp was ran, it gave 10 outputs.
1. The original image

RGB images
2. The image was from the red channel of the image. This image was very bright.
3. The Green channel showed a much darker and sharper image.
4. The Blue channel was virtually the mean of the green and red channels.

YCbCr Images
5. The Y component was similar to output the green channel from the RGB image just that this image had “lighter blacks’
6.The Cb component was a blur image which mainly focused on the outlines of the image.
7. The Cr component was similar to the Cb component just that its dark and bright areas were the inverse of the Cb component


HSV images
8. The Hue was an image with dark patches
9. The saturation resembled the negative of a camera film
10. The Value was the same as the red channel from the RGB image
