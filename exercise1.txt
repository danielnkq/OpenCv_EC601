Images are made up of rows and columns. Using the ‘at’ function (ImageName.at) you can specify your columns and rows . The object type has to be specified in angle brackets ( example:   ImageName.at<uint8_t >(r,c) ) , this determines the size of the image.
For color images, they have 3 channels of information (blue, Green , red).in the angled brackets we define the number of channels using cv::vector (example: ImageName.at<cv::vec3b>(roc)[0] ). The value in the square bracket represents the Blue, Green, Red Channels where [0] is blue, [1] is Green and [2] is red when BGR components are being used.
